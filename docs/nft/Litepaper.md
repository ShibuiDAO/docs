# Litepaper

## Overview

The following lite paper reviews the ShibuiNFT project, which is a Boba Network native NFT marketplace, governed by the Boba Network community. The project is being developed by the Shibui organisation as a DAO, under the leadership of [`quantumlyy`](https://twitter.com/quantumlyy).

## Motivation

We consider Boba Network and its technology as one of the best examples of an Ethereum L2 scaling solution that we’ve got currently available on the market. The ShibuiNFT marketplace was created from a simple desire to address the current situation of NFT assets on Boba Network: the NFTs are not being used to their full potential on Boba and that’s why we decided to tackle the problem.

We are also firm believers in decentralisation and community involvement, so this is why we have decided for ShibuiNFT (alongside Shibui as a whole) to become controlled by an on-chain governance system.
